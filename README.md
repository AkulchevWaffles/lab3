# lab3

in order to run the program. one would have to copy the txt file "Cows.txt" to the D-drive.
However, I'm deeply sorry that the numbers of cow would be limited to under 10 this time, since I can't figure out how to sort a vector of and unknown length, while a pre-determined length too long would have the "vector subscript out of range" error messsage pop up.
As for part B of the lab, I can't find slide 24,25 on the sheet
